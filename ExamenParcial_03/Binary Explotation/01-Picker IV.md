# Picker IV

## Descripción: 
Can you figure out how this program works to get the flag?Connect to the program with netcat:`$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 64715`The program's source code can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/529/picker-IV.c). The binary can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/529/picker-IV).

**Pistas:**
1. With Python, there are no binaries. With compiled languages like C, there is source code, and there are binaries. Binaries are created from source code, they are a conversion from the human-readable source code, to the highly efficient machine language, in this case: x86_64.
2. How can you find the address that `win` is at?
